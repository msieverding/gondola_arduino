ideas:
- Scan for wifi networks and show them on html page (user can enter PW for a given network to connect)
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- compile everything with Wall to find unused vars etc.
- checksum for EEPROM
- save gondolas position in EEPROM
- one can use std::bind to bind arguments on function pointers (maybe for CI)
- maybe one can use std::function to bind non-static functions

- save spooled distance of HardwareAnchor in Config/EEPROM

- how to get current position now?
  -> call if anchor is finished
  -> if all anchors are finished update m_CurrentPosition

- check, wether ip is already registered (no doubled anchor)
- maybe, if possible, check when slave disconnects

- delete gondola, when master is destructed

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
- 8 LEDs to show LSB of IP address instead of LCD
- 1 LED for erstablished connection
- 1 or 2 LEDs for mode
