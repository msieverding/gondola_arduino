ideas:
- Class for logging in different modes (VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, ...)
- Some strings as constants to save computation time
- Update the spooled distance during spooling
- Consider missed time in anchor.cpp (startStep)
- Move movement code into Anchor class
- Change IP with CL commands
- command to show all registered commands
- If WifI connection is not established after a fixed time -> fallback in AP mode
- If Password is not given -> don't use (test it)
- If AP does not work -> fall back to last known config
- Scan for wifi networks and show them on html page (user can enter PW for a given network to connect)
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- find issues with mDNS after switching between AP and WF
- Configuration class with EEPROM access (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/EEPROM)
- compile everything with Wall to find unused vars etc.

Command Line interpreter:
- set initial position of Anchors and Gondola
- change values for AP and WIFI through a command if wifi is broken

WebSite
- Same header on every webpage with standard information and standard links
- Site for setting initial position
- Show actual position(settings) directly inside the input fields

Notes:
- WiFiManager (https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/blob/master/WiFiManager.cpp)
