ideas:
- Scan for wifi networks and show them on html page (user can enter PW for a given network to connect)
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- save gondolas position in EEPROM
- save spooled distance of HardwareAnchor in Config/EEPROM
- use speed for movement :-D

- check, wether ip is already registered (no doubled anchor)
- maybe, if possible, check when a slave disconnects
- mabye, if possible, call AddWebAnchor webpage when a slave got a new connection
- maybe? Don't store connection and server type in config AND in class -> can cause logical errros in programmers brain

- DualConnection as a heritage of APConnection and WiFiConnection to use their members and methods?

- website to print serial debug output
- reconnect, when network disappears

- slave must check answer from master. Actually it accepts every answer and think it's connected

- delete static variables from config.hpp and put them into the Config class
- check spooling speed an spooledDistance.. looks not right actually

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
- 8 LEDs to show LSB of IP address instead of LCD
- 1 LED for erstablished connection
- 1 or 2 LEDs for mode


Out of code documentation:
- Setup ATOM build environment
- Fetcher checksum in EEPROM
