ideas:
- Rewrite Gondola::move() in a smarter way + Update the spooled distance during spooling + Consider missed time in anchor.cpp (startStep) + Move movement code into Anchor class
- Scan for wifi networks and show them on html page (user can enter PW for a given network to connect)
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- compile everything with Wall to find unused vars etc.
- checksum for EEPROM
- save gondolas position in EEPROM

Command Line interpreter:
- set initial position of Anchors and Gondola

WebSite

Notes:
- WiFiManager (https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/blob/master/WiFiManager.cpp)

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
