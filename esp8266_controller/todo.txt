ideas:
- Class for logging in different modes (VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, ...)
- Some strings as constants to save computation time
- Update the spooled distance during spooling
- Add missed spooling time in computation due to new spooling
- Change movement into Anchor class
- Save config and actual position in EEPROM: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/EEPROM
- Change IP with CL commands
- ConnectionMgr Class to reduce code in main (singleton with one serial callback)
- command to show all registered commands

Command Line interpreter
- set initial position of Anchors and Gondola

WebSite
- Site for setting initial position
- Show actual position directly inside the input fields
