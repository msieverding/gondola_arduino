TODO:
- Scan for wifi networks and show them on html page (user can enter PW for a given network to connect)
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- save spooled distance of HardwareAnchor in Config/EEPROM
- use speed for movement :-D

- shorter timeout while registering at master

- check, wether ip is already registered (no doubled anchor)
- maybe, if possible, check when a slave disconnects
- mabye, if possible, call AddWebAnchor webpage when a slave got a new connection
- maybe? Don't store connection and server type in config AND in class -> can cause logical errros in programmers brain

- website to print serial debug output
- check spooling speed an spooledDistance.. looks not right actually
- [AP] show IPAddresses of clients: http://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=5669#

Known issues:
- Windows can't handle a new ESP8266 with the same Network name without removing the old one

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
- 8 LEDs to show LSB of IP address instead of LCD
- 1 LED for erstablished connection
- 1 or 2 LEDs for mode


Out of code documentation:
- Setup ATOM build environment
- Add libraries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBlHNBNHESQ)
- Fetcher checksum in EEPROM

Sources:
- MqTT Server for ESP8266: https://github.com/FrancescoBaroneItaly/ME-MqTT-Server-for-ESP8266
  - Necessary to install certain libraries. They will show up as errors while building :D
