TODO:
- find issue for curious serial output at startup
- use speed for movement :-D
- check spooling speed and spooledDistance.. looks not right actually

- website to print serial debug output
- print whole configuration at startup ?!

- Change AnchorPos through web interface
- Set Gondola position through web interface

- client connects take a long time... -> maybe use async client from library (https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP/blob/master/src/ESPAsyncTCP.h)
- Take a look on this async MQTT client (https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client)

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
- 8 LEDs to show LSB of IP address instead of LCD
- 1 LED for established connection


Out of code documentation:
- Setup ATOM build environment
- Add libraries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBlHNBNHESQ)
- Fetcher checksum in EEPROM
- Using std::bind with placeholders from #include <functional> with std::placeholder::_1 ..  _N

  - Necessary to install certain libraries. They will show up as errors while building :D
