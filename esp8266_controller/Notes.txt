TODO:
- Output on WebBrowser Page...
- Test for a memory leack with the esp free heap (name?) function
- check class diagramm (anchor is missing and some things changed. See commits)
- 1 std. config server and 2 std. config client
- Consistent Configuration opportunities. (IP can be changed, but websocket server ip not.. useless...)
 - Also total spool is not needed any more. delete it.
- calc system boundaries with anchor positions
 - if it's available after movement reload after 500 ms and than after m_Gondola->getMovetime() - 500
- Check if what marco said about the spooled distance and the steps and the error... don't know how to say it^^



Possible tests:
- Given rope length with different weights (as different angles. Maybe calc load factor)

Ideas:
- Use NTP for a time (maybe good for debug output, etc..). NTP is used here (https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-arduino-protocol-http/blob/master/examples/simplesample_http/simplesample_http.ino)
- Async WebServer (https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)
- WebSocket Server and Cient (https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)
 - Can use AsyncTCP with :https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP
  - manual change in file necessary
 - see in readme of https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome

Hardware Ideas:
- Reset (SW-)button to use default configuration (open AP...)
- LCD to show Configuration or LEDs to show state
- 8 LEDs to show LSB of IP address instead of LCD
- 1 LED for established connection

Out of code documentation:
- Setup ATOM build environment
- Add libraries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBlHNBNHESQ)
- Fetcher checksum in EEPROM
- compiler optiization -O3 for maxium speed. Size does not matter on this chip

Unused libraries:
- PubSubClient
- AsyncMqttClient (https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client)
 - 11.09.2017: Client recieves multiple messages and crashes.
- MqTT Server for ESP8266: https://github.com/FrancescoBaroneItaly/ME-MqTT-Server-for-ESP8266
 - Necessary to install certain libraries. They will show up as errors while building :D
 - Tutorial: http://bartech.mybluemix.net/2017/07/19/me-project-setup-mqtt-server-instance-on-esp8266/#more-828
- async MqTT Client used in MQTTClientAsync: (https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client)
- use json? - JSON writer (https://github.com/maxpowel/ArduinoJsonWriter/blob/master/JsonWriter.cpp)
 - Unnecessary overhead -> not used. Binary protocoll

Used libraries:
- WebSocket Server and Cient (https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)
